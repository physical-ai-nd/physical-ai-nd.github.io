  <h1>Physical AI Working Group</h1>

  <div>Supported by the <a href="https://strategicframework.nd.edu/initiatives/data-ai-computing/">Data, AI, and Computing (DAC) Initiative</a> at the University of Notre Dame</div>
  <br>

  <h2>Upcoming Event</h2>

  <p><b>Physical AI Meetup and Graduate Student Poster Session</b></p>
  
  <p><b>Date:</b> Tuesday, February 24</p>

  <p><b>Time:</b> 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM</p>

  <p><b>Location:</b> 217 Cushing Hall</p>

  <p>We have received 20+ graduate student posters. We are excited for a lively and interactive session.</p>

  <p>We strongly encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to showcase your work and engage with the growing Physical AI community at Notre Dame.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>

    <div><b>Physical AI</b> is an emerging frontier that will define how AI interacts with, learns from, and safely transforms the physical world. This area is essential in advancing AI-Enabled Science and Engineering through intelligent, data-driven physical systems that accelerate innovations and discovery in domains such as mobility, inspection, and human-robot collaboration. It also pushes Foundational AI, as embodied agents demand new models for spatial intelligence, multimodal data synthesis, and simulation-to-real learning.</div>

    <br>
  
    <div><b>Physical AI</b> directly contributes to <a href="https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/news-events/rise-ai-society-conference/">RISE</a> (Responsible, Inclusive, Safe and Ethical) AI, since embodied systems raise urgent questions of safety, trust, inclusivity, and societal impact. ND is uniquely positioned to lead given its existing technical expertise in foundation models (FMs), system simulation, formal methods, and experimental robotics that pair with its mission-driven focus on ethics, dignity, and responsible innovation.</div>

    <br>
  
    <div>By combining strengths across these areas, our <b>Mission</b> is to differentiate Notre Dame nationally through a holistic approach that unites technical excellence with human-centered values to shape the future of safe and responsible Physical AI. By the end of the Spring semester, we offer a report to recomend faculty recruitment, interdisciplinary partnerships across engineering, science, and ethics, and priority areas for strategic investment such as simulation infrastructure, AI development, and human-machine teaming applications.</div>

  <h2>Events</h2>

    <div>The working groups invite all members to join <b>four monthly meetings</b>. The goal is to map Notre Dame's existing strengths in data science, foundation models, and robotics, and to identify key opportunities in Physical AI. Tentative plan: (1) discussions in January, (2) student oral or poster presentations in February, (3) report outlines in March, and (4) findings summary in April.</div>

    <br>

    <div>In addition, the group will host <b>two seminars</b> featuring distinguished external speakers, targeting one technical leader from established industry and one founder or innovation leader from an emerging startup.</div>

    <br>
